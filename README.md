# DESI_Dark_Matter_Cascade
This code is used to compute H(z) for a universe with a dark sector that has a decay cascade of the form A -> B -> C -> D. This is used to produce DESI-like Hubble expansion. We also consider a self-interacting dark matter candidate that emerges naturally as a by-product, and compute its scattering cross section.
